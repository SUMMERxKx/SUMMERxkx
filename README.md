### 👋 Hello

I’m **Samar Khajuria**.  
I enjoy building full-stack products, experimenting with AI-driven ideas, and constantly pushing myself to learn new things.  
Most of my projects start with curiosity — and end with something useful (or at least interesting).

---

### 🧭 What I’m focused on

- Building end-to-end products and side projects  
- Exploring how AI can make everyday work easier  
- Learning through challenges, experiments, and breaking things  
- Collaborating with people who enjoy building

---

### 🚀 What you can expect from me

**AI-first thinking**  
I like exploring how intelligent systems can quietly improve workflows and user experiences.

**End-to-end building**  
From rough ideas to something people can actually use — I enjoy seeing things through.

**Thoughtful collaboration**  
Clear communication, clean docs, and being easy to work with matter to me.

### 🧩 Projects

Most of my work lives here on GitHub — side projects, experiments, and things I’m actively improving.

⚡ **Fun fact:** I love challenges — especially the kind that teach me something new.
